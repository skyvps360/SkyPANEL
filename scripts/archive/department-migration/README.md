# Department Migration Scripts Archive

This directory contains archived scripts from the SkyPANEL department migration process.

## Background

SkyPANEL previously had separate department systems for tickets (`ticket_departments`) and live chat (`chat_departments`). These were migrated to a unified department system using the `support_departments` table.

## Migration Process

The migration was completed successfully, with all tickets and chat sessions now referencing the unified `support_departments` table. The following scripts were used during the migration process and are now archived:

## Archived Scripts

- `fix-department-synchronization.ts` - Script to synchronize departments between legacy tables
- Additional migration scripts were cleaned up in previous maintenance cycles

## Current Status

✅ **Migration Complete**: All systems now use the unified `support_departments` table
✅ **Foreign Keys Updated**: All references point to the unified table
✅ **Legacy Cleanup**: Legacy storage methods and API routes have been removed
✅ **Chat-to-Ticket Conversion**: Working properly with unified departments

## Notes

- Legacy tables (`ticket_departments`, `chat_departments`) are kept for backward compatibility
- All active code now uses the unified system via `storage.getSupportDepartments()` and related methods
- The migration service in `server/services/department-migration.ts` maintains sync for compatibility
