# SLA System Implementation TODO

## Overview
Adding a Service Level Agreement (SLA) system to the admin legal section, similar to the existing Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy system.

## Tasks

### Backend Implementation
- [x] Add SLA database schema to shared/schema.ts (Already supports any legal content type)
- [x] Update server routes to handle SLA content (GET/POST /api/admin/legal) (Already supports any type)
- [x] Add SLA type to legal content validation schema (Already supports any type)
- [x] Update public legal endpoint to serve SLA content (Already supports any type)

### Frontend Implementation
- [x] Add SLA tab to legal editor page (/admin/legal)
- [x] Update legal editor form to handle SLA content type
- [x] Add SLA navigation to admin layout (Added to both public and dashboard footers)
- [x] Create public SLA page for users to view
- [x] Update brand theming consistency

### Database Updates
- [x] Ensure legal_content table supports SLA type (Already supports any type)
- [x] Add any necessary migrations if schema changes needed (No changes needed)

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test SLA creation and editing in admin panel
- [ ] Test public SLA page display
- [ ] Verify brand theming consistency
- [ ] Test form validation and error handling

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation for SLA endpoints
- [ ] Add comments to new/modified code

## Notes
- Follow existing TOS/Privacy pattern for consistency
- Use brand theming system (no hardcoded colors)
- Maintain same validation and security patterns
- Ensure proper admin access controls

## Progress
Most backend functionality was already in place. The legal content system was designed to handle any type of legal document. Main work involved:
1. Adding SLA tab to admin legal editor ✓
2. Creating public SLA page ✓
3. Adding routing and navigation ✓
4. Ensuring maintenance mode allows SLA page access ✓
5. Adding SLA links to both public and dashboard footers ✓

## Implementation Summary
The SLA system has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Completed Features:
1. **Admin Legal Editor**: Added SLA tab alongside TOS and Privacy Policy tabs
2. **Public SLA Page**: Created `/sla` route with default content and database integration
3. **Navigation**: Added SLA link to both public footer and dashboard footer
4. **Routing**: Added SLA route to AppRouter and MaintenanceGuard
5. **Brand Theming**: Follows existing brand theming patterns
6. **Database Integration**: Uses existing legal_content table structure

### Files Modified:
- `client/src/pages/admin/legal-editor.tsx` - Added SLA tab and form handling
- `client/src/pages/sla-page.tsx` - New SLA public page
- `client/src/components/app/AppRouter.tsx` - Added SLA route
- `client/src/components/app/MaintenanceGuard.tsx` - Added SLA to allowed paths
- `client/src/components/layout/SharedFooter.tsx` - Added SLA navigation link
- `client/src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx` - Added SLA navigation link

The system is now ready for testing and use. Admins can create and edit SLA content through the admin panel, and users can view it at `/sla`. The SLA link is available in both the public footer and the dashboard footer for easy access.
