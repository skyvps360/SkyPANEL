# Coupon Transaction Amount Fix

## Issue
- [X] **Identified Problem**: Coupon claiming system showing incorrect USD amounts in transactions
- [X] **Root Cause**: Transaction amount was set to raw token amount instead of USD equivalent
- [X] **Exchange Rate**: 100 tokens = $1 USD (confirmed from billing page)

## Fix Applied
- [X] **Updated coupon-service.ts**: Added token-to-USD conversion in transaction creation
- [X] **Added Conversion Logic**: `const usdAmount = coupon.tokensAmount / 100;`
- [X] **Updated Transaction Amount**: Changed from `coupon.tokensAmount` to `usdAmount`

## Testing Required
- [X] **Server Restarted**: Applied fix and restarted development server
- [X] **Fix Deployed**: Coupon service now converts tokens to USD (รท100) for transactions
- [ ] **Test Coupon Claiming**: Verify 1000 tokens now shows as $10.00 in transactions
- [ ] **Check Billing Page**: Confirm transaction displays correct USD amount
- [ ] **Check Admin Billing**: Verify admin billing page shows correct amounts
- [ ] **Verify Token Balance**: Ensure user still receives correct token amount

## Expected Results
- 1000 token coupon should create $10.00 transaction (not $1000.00)
- User should still receive 1000 tokens in their VirtFusion account
- Transaction history should show proper USD amounts
- Exchange rate consistency maintained across system

## Files Modified
- `server/services/coupon-service.ts` - Fixed transaction amount calculation

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix with a coupon redemption
2. Verify transaction amounts in both user and admin billing pages
3. Confirm user receives correct token balance
4. Mark as complete once verified
