# VirtFusion Billing Mode Fix Test

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where VirtFusion billing mode switching wasn't working properly. The problem was that billing mode detection was happening inside the cron jobs instead of controlling which cron jobs are active.

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Check Current Billing Mode
In the admin settings page, go to VirtFusion API settings and look at the "Self Service Hourly Credit" toggle.

### 2. Test Hourly Billing Mode
1. Set "Self Service Hourly Credit" to **Enabled (ON)**
2. Save the settings
3. Check server logs - you should see:
   ```
   ðŸ”„ VirtFusion billing mode changed to: HOURLY
   âœ… VirtFusion hourly billing cron job started (every hour)
   âœ… VirtFusion cron jobs updated for hourly billing mode
   ```

### 3. Test Monthly Billing Mode  
1. Set "Self Service Hourly Credit" to **Disabled (OFF)**
2. Save the settings
3. Check server logs - you should see:
   ```
   ðŸ”„ VirtFusion billing mode changed to: MONTHLY
   âœ… VirtFusion monthly billing cron job started (1st of month at 3 AM UTC)
   âœ… VirtFusion cron jobs updated for monthly billing mode
   ```

### 4. Verify Cron Job Status
Check the cron status endpoint `/api/admin/cron/status` to verify only the appropriate job is running:

**When Hourly Credit is Enabled:**
- `virtfusionHourly.isRunning`: `true`
- `virtfusionMonthly.isRunning`: `false`

**When Hourly Credit is Disabled:**
- `virtfusionHourly.isRunning`: `false`  
- `virtfusionMonthly.isRunning`: `true`

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **SettingsService** (`/server/settings-service.ts`):
   - Added automatic detection when `virtfusion_self_service_hourly_credit` setting changes
   - Added `handleVirtFusionBillingModeChange()` method

2. **CronService** (`/server/services/cron-service.ts`):
   - Added `updateVirtFusionCronJobsForBillingMode()` method
   - Removed internal billing mode detection from hourly billing job
   - Added startup initialization to set correct billing mode

### Key Benefits:
- âœ… No more duplicate billing charges
- âœ… Clear separation between hourly and monthly billing
- âœ… Automatic cron job switching when settings change
- âœ… Proper initialization on system startup
- âœ… No more confusion about which billing mode is active

## Before the Fix:
- Both hourly and monthly cron jobs could run simultaneously
- Hourly job would detect billing mode and switch to monthly logic internally
- Could cause billing inconsistencies and confusion

## After the Fix:
- Only one billing cron job runs at a time based on the setting
- Clear billing mode separation
- Automatic switching when admin changes the setting
- Proper initialization on startup
