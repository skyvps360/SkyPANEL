# Billing Precision Fix - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This fix resolves a critical billing precision issue where customers were being overcharged by 143% to 2820% for packages with monthly prices under $7.30.

## Problem Solved
- **Old System**: `Math.ceil(hourlyRate * 100)` rounded ANY fractional amount up to 1 cent minimum
- **Issue**: $0.50/month package charged $0.01/hour instead of $0.000685/hour (1360% overcharge!)
- **Impact**: Massive overcharging for small VPS packages

## Solution Implemented
**Accumulative Billing System**: Tracks fractional cents until they accumulate to ‚â•1 cent before billing.

### Systems Updated
1. **VirtFusion Billing System** (primary billing in `server/services/cron-service.ts`)
2. **ServerUptime Billing System** (uptime tracking in `server/services/infrastructure/server-uptime-service.ts`)

## Database Schema Changes

### 1. VirtFusion Hourly Billing Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE virtfusion_hourly_billing 
ADD COLUMN accumulated_amount DECIMAL(10,6) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0.000000';
```

### 2. Server Uptime Logs Table  
```sql
ALTER TABLE server_uptime_logs
ADD COLUMN accumulated_cost DECIMAL(10,6) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0.000000';
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Migration Scripts
```bash
# Add accumulated_amount to virtfusion_hourly_billing
npm run ts scripts/add-accumulated-amount-column.ts

# Add accumulated_cost to server_uptime_logs  
npm run ts scripts/add-server-uptime-accumulated-cost.ts
```

### 2. Verify Database Changes
```sql
-- Check virtfusion_hourly_billing column
SELECT column_name, data_type, numeric_precision, numeric_scale
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'virtfusion_hourly_billing' 
AND column_name = 'accumulated_amount';

-- Check server_uptime_logs column
SELECT column_name, data_type, numeric_precision, numeric_scale
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'server_uptime_logs' 
AND column_name = 'accumulated_cost';
```

### 3. Test Billing Logic
The new system will automatically:
- Track fractional amounts in the new `accumulated_*` fields
- Only charge VirtFusion when accumulated amount ‚â• $0.01
- Maintain perfect precision without overcharging
- Work with existing billing records (accumulated amounts default to $0.000000)

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
| Package | Hourly Rate | Old Charge/Hour | Monthly Overcharge |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| $3.00   | $0.004110   | $0.0100        | +$4.30 (143%)     |
| $0.50   | $0.000685   | $0.0100        | +$6.80 (1360%)    |
| $0.25   | $0.000342   | $0.0100        | +$7.05 (2820%)    |

### After Fix
| Package | Hourly Rate | New Charge Behavior | Monthly Accuracy |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| $3.00   | $0.004110   | Charges 1¬¢ every ~2.4 hours | Perfect ($3.00) |
| $0.50   | $0.000685   | Charges 1¬¢ every ~14.6 hours | Perfect ($0.50) |
| $0.25   | $0.000342   | Charges 1¬¢ every ~29.2 hours | Perfect ($0.25) |

## Customer Impact
- **Immediate**: Customers stop being overcharged
- **Savings**: Small package users save $3.98-$7.05 per month (59-96% savings)
- **Accuracy**: Perfect billing precision maintained
- **Transparency**: Clear audit trail of charged vs accumulated amounts

## Monitoring & Verification

### 1. Check Accumulative Amounts
```sql
-- View current accumulated amounts
SELECT 
  server_id,
  user_id, 
  monthly_price,
  accumulated_amount,
  last_billed_at
FROM virtfusion_hourly_billing 
WHERE billing_enabled = true
ORDER BY accumulated_amount DESC;
```

### 2. Verify No Overcharging
```sql
-- Check recent transactions for fair pricing
SELECT 
  vht.*,
  vhb.monthly_price,
  vhb.accumulated_amount
FROM virtfusion_hourly_transactions vht
JOIN virtfusion_hourly_billing vhb ON vht.billing_id = vhb.id
WHERE vht.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
AND vht.status = 'completed'
ORDER BY vht.created_at DESC;
```

### 3. Monitor Billing Events
The logs will show:
```
üí∞ Billing hour 1/1:
   Hourly Rate: $0.004110
   Accumulated: $0.004110
   Tokens to charge: 0 (should bill: false)
   ‚è≥ Not billing yet (accumulated < $0.01)

üí∞ Billing hour 3/1:  
   Accumulated: $0.012330
   üí≥ Charging 1 tokens ($0.0100)
   üí∞ Remaining accumulated: $0.002330
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)
If any issues arise, the old billing logic can be temporarily restored by reverting the `Math.floor()` back to `Math.ceil()` in:
- `server/services/cron-service.ts` (line ~904)
- `server/services/infrastructure/server-uptime-service.ts` (line ~267)

However, this would reintroduce the overcharging issue.

## Support & Communication
Consider informing customers about the billing improvements:
- "We've improved our billing system for better accuracy"
- "Small package customers will see reduced charges"
- "No action required - changes are automatic"

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ No more overcharging complaints
- ‚úÖ Increased customer satisfaction for small packages
- ‚úÖ Perfect billing accuracy (charged + accumulated = expected)
- ‚úÖ Reduced support tickets about billing discrepancies

This fix ensures fair, accurate billing while maintaining the existing VirtFusion token-based payment system.
