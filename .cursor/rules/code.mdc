- when i tell you something i want you to use the sequential_thinking tool. 
- Check for what im telling you if it corrisponds with whats already in our codebase by calling the codebase tools
- make sure to always abide by the @brand-theme.md settings.
- when you are running a task you must make a todo.md this file will have steps of what needs to be done one by one and will show [ ] for uncompleted and [x] for completed when a task or set of tasks from the todo.md file is completed, once you have finished completly with the todo.md and can confirm with the end user you are todo delete the todo.md file, thus allowing you to make a new todo for every new task. if you are asking a follow up question tho dont delete the todo as this means of course you are not completed the task at hand.
- always use codacy mcp and toolset to make sure my applicaiton is properly secure and setup correctly.
- never leave linting errors or code errors, this means if there is one go back use sequential_thinking to understand the issue to better debug and fix the issue.
- when writing, deleting or editing lines of codes or files make sure to always comment the file change.

- when working on my applicaiton make sure to commit to your memory everything new that might not already be in your memroy.
