# Rules to abide by

- when i tell you something i want you to use the sequential_thinking tool.
- Check for what im telling you if it corrisponds with whats already in our codebase by calling the codebase tools
- if you are unsure or not aware of how to do something please use the web search tool to search for how to complete the job correctly.
- make sure to always abide by the @brand-theme.md settings.
- never leave linting errors or code errors, this means if there is one go back use sequential_thinking to understand the issue to better debug and fix the issue.
- when writing, deleting or editing lines of codes or files make sure to always comment the file change.
- when working on my applicaiton make sure to commit to your memory everything new that might not already be in your memroy.
- always use the to-dos too set this way you ca keep better track of what you are doing.
