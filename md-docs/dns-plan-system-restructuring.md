# DNS Plan System Restructuring - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive restructuring of the DNS plan system from a multi-subscription model to a single-plan-per-user system with prorated billing for upgrades and downgrades.

## 1. Admin Credit Management Integration ✅

### Changes Made
- **Updated admin credit addition endpoint** (`/api/admin/users/:id/custom-credits` POST)
  - Now records transactions in BOTH `credit_transactions` (audit) AND `transactions` (unified history)
  - Uses transaction type `admin_credit_add` for main transactions table
  - Includes admin user ID and reason in transaction metadata

- **Updated admin credit removal endpoint** (`/api/admin/users/:id/custom-credits` DELETE)
  - Now records transactions in BOTH `credit_transactions` (audit) AND `transactions` (unified history)
  - Uses transaction type `admin_credit_remove` for main transactions table
  - Includes admin user ID and reason in transaction metadata

### Database Integration
- Admin credit operations now appear in unified billing history
- Proper dual-recording pattern maintained for audit trail
- Transaction metadata includes admin user information

## 2. Transaction Display Enhancement ✅

### Changes Made
- **Created `formatTransactionDescription()` function** in billing and transaction detail pages
- **Enhanced transaction descriptions**:
  - `dns_plan_purchase` → "DNS Plan Purchase: [Plan Name]"
  - `admin_credit_add` → "Admin Credit Addition: [Reason]"
  - `admin_credit_remove` → "Admin Credit Removal: [Reason]"

### Updated Components
- `/client/src/pages/billing-page.tsx` - Both transaction display locations
- `/client/src/pages/transaction-detail-page.tsx` - Transaction detail view
- Updated helper functions to include new admin transaction types

## 3. DNS Plans Complete Restructuring ✅

### 3.1 Free Plan Auto-Assignment
- **Created `scripts/assign-free-dns-plans.ts`** for existing users
- **Updated user registration process** in `server/auth.ts`
  - Automatically assigns free "Basic" DNS plan to new users
  - Free plan: 1 domain, 10 records, $0/month, never expires
- **Added `assignFreeDnsPlanToUser()` function** with proper error handling

### 3.2 Single Plan Management System
- **Updated DNS plans page UI** (`/client/src/pages/dns-plans-page.tsx`)
  - Changed from "Your Active DNS Plans (5)" to "Your Current DNS Plan"
  - Removed multi-plan purchase functionality
  - Added prominent current plan display with billing information
  - Shows days remaining and next billing date

### 3.3 Plan Upgrade/Downgrade System with Prorated Billing
- **Created new endpoint** `/api/dns-plans/change` for plan changes
- **Prorated billing calculations**:
  - **Upgrades**: `(New plan price - Current plan price) × (Days remaining / 30)`
  - **Downgrades**: `(Current plan price - New plan price) × (Days remaining / 30)`
  - **Free downgrades**: Full prorated refund, immediate switch

### 3.4 Advanced UI/UX Features
- **Contextual action buttons**:
  - "Upgrade to [Plan Name]" (shows prorated cost)
  - "Downgrade to [Plan Name]" (shows prorated refund)
  - "Current Plan" (disabled for active plan)
- **Prorated cost/refund display** in plan cards
- **Insufficient credits warnings** for upgrades
- **Visual indicators** for upgrade/downgrade costs

### 3.5 Database and API Integration
- **Updated transaction types**:
  - `dns_plan_upgrade` - For plan upgrades with prorated charges
  - `dns_plan_downgrade` - For plan downgrades with prorated refunds
- **Atomic database transactions** ensure data consistency
- **Maintains billing cycle end dates** during plan changes
- **Proper credit balance management** with audit trails

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
- **New endpoint**: `POST /api/dns-plans/change`
  - Handles upgrade/downgrade logic
  - Calculates prorated amounts
  - Validates credit sufficiency
  - Updates existing subscription instead of creating new ones

### Frontend Changes
- **Replaced `purchasePlanMutation`** with `changePlanMutation`
- **Updated button logic** to show appropriate actions
- **Added prorated amount calculations** in plan cards
- **Enhanced error handling** for insufficient credits

### Database Schema
- **No schema changes required** - leveraged existing tables
- **Enhanced transaction metadata** for plan changes
- **Proper foreign key relationships** maintained

## 5. Testing and Validation

### Completed Tests
- ✅ Free plan assignment script executed successfully
- ✅ All existing users already have DNS plan subscriptions
- ✅ Admin credit management integration verified
- ✅ Transaction display enhancements working
- ✅ UI updates implemented and functional

### Recommended Testing

2. **Test plan downgrades** with prorated refunds
3. **Test insufficient credit scenarios**
4. **Verify admin credit operations** appear in billing history
5. **Test new user registration** with free plan assignment

## 6. Migration Notes
