# Billing System

## Overview
The Billing System in SkyPANEL manages all financial transactions and credit-based billing for the platform. It integrates with payment gateways, tracks usage, and handles billing cycles for both customers and administrators. The system uses a credit-based model where users purchase credits that are automatically deducted based on VirtFusion resource usage.
