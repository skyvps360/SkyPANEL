## Architecture

### Components
1. **Agents**: Collect data from applications and infrastructure
2. **Collectors**: Aggregate and process telemetry data
3. **Storage**: Time-series databases for metrics and logs
4. **Visualization**: Dashboards and exploration tools
5. **Alerting**: Notification and incident management

### Data Flow
```
[Applications] → [Agents] → [Collectors] → [Storage] → [Visualization]

## Logging

### Log Levels
| Level | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| ERROR | System is in distress | When application encounters error that requires attention |
| WARN | Not an error, but indicates potential issues | When application can continue but something unusual happened |
| INFO | Normal operational messages | When important business process completed |
| DEBUG | Detailed information for debugging | When you need to see detailed execution flow |
| TRACE | Very detailed debugging information | When you need to see the most detailed execution flow |

### Structured Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-06-07T16:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "api-gateway",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "span_id": "def456",
  "message": "Request completed",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/api/users",
  "status": 200,
  "duration_ms": 45,
  "user_id": "user_123"
}
```

### Log Retention
- **Development**: 7 days
- **Staging**: 30 days
- **Production**: 365 days (hot), 5 years (cold)

## Metrics

### Key Metrics

#### Application Metrics
- **Request Rate**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Latency**: P50, P90, P99, P99.9
- **Saturation**: Resource utilization
- **Throughput**: Requests processed per second

#### System Metrics
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network I/O
- Database connections

#### Business Metrics
- Active users
- Signup conversion rate
- API usage
- Subscription metrics

### Metric Types
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Counter | Monotonically increasing value | Total requests |
| Gauge | Instantaneous measurement | Current memory usage |
| Histogram | Samples observations | Request duration |
| Summary | Similar to histogram, but calculates quantiles | Request size |

## Distributed Tracing

### Spans
```json
{
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "span_id": "def456",
  "parent_span_id": "xyz789",
  "name": "database.query",
  "service": "user-service",
  "start_time": "2023-06-07T16:30:00Z",
  "end_time": "2023-06-07T16:30:01Z",
  "tags": {
    "db.statement": "SELECT * FROM users",
    "db.type": "postgresql",
    "span.kind": "client"
  },
  "logs": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-06-07T16:30:00.500Z",
      "fields": {
        "event": "query_started"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Trace Context Propagation
1. **HTTP Headers**
   - `traceparent`: W3C Trace Context
   - `tracestate`: Additional tracing system-specific data
   - `baggage`: Key-value pairs for context propagation

2. **gRPC Metadata**
   - `grpc-trace-bin`: Binary format for trace context
   - `grpc-tags-bin`: Binary format for tags

## Alerting

### Alert Levels
| Level | Response Time | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| P0 | Immediate | Production down |
| P1 | 15 minutes | High error rate |
| P2 | 1 hour | Performance degradation |
| P3 | 4 hours | Warning conditions |
| P4 | Next business day | Informational |

### Alert Conditions
```yaml
alert: HighErrorRate
expr: |
  (
    sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
    /
    sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
  ) * 100 > 5
for: 5m
labels:
  severity: critical
  team: backend
annotations:
  summary: "High error rate on {{ $labels.instance }}"
  description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}%"
```

## Dashboarding

### Key Dashboards
1. **Service Health**
   - Request rate
   - Error rate
   - Latency
   - Saturation

2. **Infrastructure**
   - CPU/Memory/Disk usage
   - Network I/O
   - Database performance

3. **Business Metrics**
   - User signups
   - Active users
   - Conversion rates
   - Revenue metrics

### Dashboard Design Principles
- Follow the "4 Golden Signals" (Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation)
- Group related metrics
- Use appropriate visualizations
- Include relevant time ranges
- Add annotations for deployments and incidents

## Synthetic Monitoring

### Check Types
1. **HTTP Checks**
   - Endpoint availability
   - Response time
   - Status code validation
   - Content validation

2. **Browser Checks**
   - User journey testing
   - Performance metrics
   - Visual regression

3. **API Tests**
   - Functional testing
   - Performance testing
   - Contract validation

### Example Check
```yaml
checks:
  api_health:
    http:
      url: https://api.example.com/health
      method: GET
      timeout: 5s
      expect_status: [200]
      headers:
        Accept: application/json
      body:
        status: "ok"
    interval: 1m
    alert:
      - type: threshold
        rule: response_time > 1000
      - type: absence
        seconds: 300
```

## Incident Management

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**
   - Automated alerts
   - User reports
   - Manual observation

2. **Response**
   - Acknowledge incident
   - Assemble response team
   - Communicate status

3. **Mitigation**
   - Implement workaround
   - Deploy fix
   - Verify resolution

4. **Post-Mortem**
   - Document incident
   - Identify root cause
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Share learnings

### Runbook Example
```markdown
# High Error Rate on API

## Symptoms
- 5xx errors > 5% of requests
- Increased latency
- Alerts firing

## Immediate Actions
1. Check dashboard for affected services
2. Verify recent deployments
3. Check database connection pool
4. Scale up if needed

## Escalation Path
1. Primary On-call (P0-P2)
2. Team Lead (P0-P1)
3. Engineering Director (P0)

## Resolution Steps
1. Rollback last deployment if needed
2. Restart affected services
3. Clear cache if applicable
4. Verify resolution
```

## Best Practices

### Logging Best Practices
