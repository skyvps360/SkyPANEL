# GitHub Copilot Integration

SkyPANEL is fully integrated with GitHub Copilot to enhance developer productivity. This integration provides intelligent code suggestions, automates common tasks, and helps maintain coding standards throughout the project.

## Copilot Configuration

We've configured GitHub Copilot specifically for SkyPANEL with:

- Custom instructions for the codebase
- Project-specific patterns and best practices
- Guidance for common development tasks

## Using Copilot with SkyPANEL

The following resources are available to help you use GitHub Copilot effectively with this project:

- **Configuration File**: `.github/copilot/configuration.yml` contains project-specific settings
- **Usage Guidelines**: `.github/GITHUB_COPILOT.md` provides detailed guidance
- **Comprehensive Guide**: `COPILOT.md` in the root directory includes examples and patterns

## Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Development**: Get intelligent code suggestions based on SkyPANEL patterns
- **Consistent Code Style**: Copilot suggestions follow project coding standards
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Automate repetitive code patterns
- **Contextual Help**: Get API and component suggestions based on the current context
