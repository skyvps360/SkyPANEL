# Migration from Stripe to PayPal in SkyPANEL

This document describes the migration process from Stripe to PayPal as the payment processor for SkyPANEL.

## Overview

SkyPANEL has migrated from Stripe to PayPal for payment processing. This migration involved removing Stripe dependencies and implementing PayPal integration for all billing-related functionality.

## Changes Made

### Dependencies Removed

The following Stripe-related dependencies were removed from `package.json`:

```diff
- "@stripe/react-stripe-js": "^3.7.0",
- "@stripe/stripe-js": "^7.3.0",
```

Note that the `stripe` server-side package may still be referenced in the codebase and should be refactored or removed in future updates.

### New Dependencies Added

PayPal integration requires setting up the following environment variables:

```
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
VITE_PAYPAL_SECRET=your_paypal_secret
```

## Implementation Details

### PayPal Integration

PayPal integration uses the PayPal JavaScript SDK for frontend components and REST API for backend operations. The implementation follows these patterns:

#### Frontend Integration

1. **PayPal Button Component**: Implemented in the checkout flow to handle payments
2. **Subscription Management**: For recurring billing plans
3. **Transaction History**: For displaying payment history

#### Backend Integration

1. **Payment Verification**: Server-side verification of payments
2. **Subscription Webhooks**: Handling recurring billing events
3. **Refund Processing**: Managing refunds and credits

### Code Structure

The PayPal integration is structured as follows:

- `client/src/components/billing/`: Frontend billing components
- `server/billing/`: Backend billing services
- `server/webhooks/`: PayPal webhook handlers

## Migration Steps

If you're maintaining or forking this codebase, follow these steps to complete the migration:

1. **Obtain PayPal API Credentials**

   - Create a PayPal Developer Account
   - Generate API credentials (Client ID and Secret)
   - Set up webhooks for subscription events

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Add the following to your environment:

   ```
   VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
   VITE_PAYPAL_SECRET=your_paypal_secret
   ```

3. **Update Frontend Components**

   - Replace any Stripe Elements with PayPal components
   - Update checkout flows to use PayPal buttons
   - Update subscription management UI

4. **Update Backend Services**

   - Modify payment processing logic to use PayPal APIs
   - Implement webhook handlers for PayPal events
   - Update database schemas if necessary

5. **Testing**

   - Test single payments
   - Test subscription creation and management
   - Test webhooks using PayPal's Sandbox environment
   - Verify refund processing

## PayPal vs. Stripe Comparison

### Advantages of PayPal

- Wider consumer recognition and trust
- Built-in buyer and seller protection
- Simpler integration for basic use cases
- No requirement for PCI compliance (handled by PayPal)

### Potential Challenges

- Different API structure from Stripe
- Webhook handling differences
- Slightly different fee structure
- Different subscription management approach

## Testing the Integration

To test the PayPal integration:

1. Use PayPal's Sandbox environment
2. Create test buyer and seller accounts
3. Process test payments through the checkout flow
4. Verify webhook handling for subscription events
5. Test refund processing

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise with the PayPal integration, a rollback plan should include:

1. Reinstalling Stripe dependencies
2. Restoring Stripe integration code from version control
3. Updating environment variables to use Stripe API keys
4. Communicating changes to users

## Future Considerations

- Monitor PayPal API changes and update integration as needed
- Consider implementing multiple payment methods for user choice
- Regularly audit security practices for payment processing
- Keep transaction records synced between PayPal and your database
