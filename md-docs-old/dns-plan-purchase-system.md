# DNS Plan Purchase System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete DNS plan purchase system that has been implemented in SkyPANEL, allowing clients to purchase DNS plans using custom credits.

## System Components

### 1. Backend API Endpoints

#### DNS Plans Management
- **`GET /api/dns-plans`** - List all available DNS plans
- **`GET /api/dns-plans/subscriptions`** - Get user's DNS plan subscriptions  
- **`POST /api/dns-plans/purchase`** - Purchase a DNS plan using custom credits
- **`POST /api/dns-plans/cancel`** - Cancel a DNS plan subscription
- **`GET /api/dns-plans/limits`** - Get user's DNS plan limits and current usage

#### Integration with Custom Credits System
- DNS plan purchases are recorded in **both** the `credit_transactions` table (audit) and main `transactions` table (unified history)
- Uses transaction type `"dns_plan_purchase"` for main transactions
- Deducts from user's custom credits balance
- Creates active DNS plan subscription

### 2. Frontend Components

#### DNS Plans Page (`/dns-plans`)
- **Hero header** with DNS plans branding
- **Custom credits balance** display
- **Available plans grid** with pricing and features
- **Active subscriptions** management section
- **Purchase workflow** with credit validation
- **Visual indicators** for plan status and affordability

#### Navigation Integration
- Added to main dashboard navigation as "DNS Plans"
- Added to search functionality
- Accessible via `/dns-plans` route

### 3. Database Integration

#### DNS Plan Purchase Workflow
```sql
-- 1. Create main transaction record
INSERT INTO transactions (userId, amount, type, description, status, paymentMethod)
VALUES (123, -15.00, 'dns_plan_purchase', 'DNS Plan Purchase: Pro Plan', 'completed', 'custom_credits');

-- 2. Update user credits balance
UPDATE user_credits SET balance = balance - 15.00 WHERE userId = 123;

-- 3. Create credit transaction audit record
INSERT INTO credit_transactions (userId, amount, type, description, status, paymentMethod, balanceBefore, balanceAfter, metadata)
VALUES (123, -15.00, 'dns_plan_purchase', 'DNS Plan Purchase: Pro Plan', 'completed', 'custom_credits', 50.00, 35.00, '{"planId": 2, "planName": "Pro Plan", "mainTransactionId": 456}');

-- 4. Create DNS plan subscription
INSERT INTO dns_plan_subscriptions (userId, planId, status, startDate, endDate, autoRenew, lastPaymentDate, nextPaymentDate)
VALUES (123, 2, 'active', NOW(), NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days', true, NOW(), NOW() + INTERVAL '27 days');
```

## DNS Plan Structure

### Available Plans
1. **Basic Plan** - $5.00/month
   - 5 domains
   - 100 DNS records per domain
   - Basic DNS management

2. **Pro Plan** - $15.00/month  
   - 25 domains
   - 500 DNS records per domain
   - Advanced DNS features

3. **Enterprise Plan** - $50.00/month
   - 100 domains
   - 1000 DNS records per domain

## Purchase Workflow

### 1. User Experience
1. User visits `/dns-plans` page
2. Views available plans and current custom credits balance
3. Selects a plan to purchase
4. System validates sufficient credits
5. Purchase is processed immediately
6. User receives confirmation and subscription becomes active

### 2. System Validation
- **Credit balance check** - Ensures user has sufficient custom credits
- **Duplicate subscription check** - Prevents multiple active subscriptions for same plan
- **Plan availability check** - Ensures plan is active and available
- **Transaction integrity** - Uses database transactions for consistency

### 3. Error Handling
- **Insufficient credits** - Clear error message with required amount
- **Duplicate subscription** - Prevents purchasing same plan twice
- **Plan not found** - Handles invalid or inactive plans
- **Database errors** - Proper rollback and error reporting

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Custom Credits System
- **Unified transaction history** - DNS plan purchases appear in main billing page
- **Visual indicators** - Green "Custom Credits" badges in transaction list
- **Balance updates** - Real-time credit balance updates after purchase
- **Audit trail** - Complete transaction history in both tables

### DNS Management System
- **Plan limits enforcement** - Domain and record limits based on active subscriptions
- **Usage tracking** - Current usage vs. plan limits
- **Upgrade prompts** - Suggestions when approaching limits

### Billing System
- **Transaction details** - Full purchase details on transaction detail pages
- **PDF exports** - DNS plan purchases included in transaction exports
- **Payment history** - Complete payment history across all services

## Security & Validation

### Payment Processing
- **Custom credits only** - No external payment processing for DNS plans
- **Balance validation** - Server-side credit balance verification
- **Transaction atomicity** - Database transactions ensure data consistency
- **Audit logging** - Complete audit trail for all transactions

### Access Control
- **User authentication** - All endpoints require valid user session
- **User isolation** - Users can only access their own subscriptions
- **Plan validation** - Server-side validation of plan availability and pricing

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
- **Plan popularity** - Track which plans are purchased most
- **Revenue tracking** - Monitor DNS plan revenue
- **Usage patterns** - Analyze domain and record usage vs. limits
- **Churn analysis** - Track subscription cancellations

### Admin Features
- **Subscription management** - Admin can view and manage all subscriptions
- **Plan configuration** - Modify plan pricing and features
- **Usage reports** - Generate usage and revenue reports

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Plan upgrades/downgrades** - Allow users to change plans
2. **Annual billing** - Offer discounted annual subscriptions  
3. **Usage alerts** - Notify users when approaching limits
4. **Plan recommendations** - Suggest optimal plans based on usage
5. **Bulk domain management** - Tools for managing many domains

### Technical Improvements
1. **Auto-renewal processing** - Automated monthly billing
2. **Usage analytics** - Detailed usage tracking and reporting
3. **Plan comparison** - Side-by-side plan comparison tools
4. **API rate limiting** - Protect DNS management APIs
5. **Backup and restore** - DNS configuration backup features

## Testing
